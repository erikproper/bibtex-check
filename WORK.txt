- Export groups:
  ErikProper.groups:
  <group>	<key>


- Reading names:
	Many to ID; ID to "the one"
	Stable ID??
	The "the one" should be a "DBLP challenged" one

- DBLP matching ... then do a fix for crossreferables ...
- DBLP Scrape checker ... all accounted for ... and ... all needed there?

---
- Simplify key mapping
  - Keep an ErikProper.keys, but only for EP ones with a non EP alias
  - ErikProper.preferred should then have two fields
  - Also have an erikp.keys as well as a basvg.keys, etc.
- Importer / sync with a helper mapping like erikp.keys
- Empower with a key mapper for known keys
----
- Optional removes on export: URL needed? DOI needed? Etc
----
- Write sorted
